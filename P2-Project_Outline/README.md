## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Recipe Tracker will be a place where cooks, bakers, chefs and foodies can post
recipes, organize their favorite recipes into cookbooks, find new recipes from
fellow community members, and share their new ideas on fellow community 
members' recipes.

### Features
1. Recipe Tracker Home page: On the home page visitors will see a link to 
   login or sign-up/register, a search feature to search recipes, and the
   currently top-rated recipes on Recipe Tracker.

2. User Portal Home page: On a user's homepage the user will see their recipes
   displayed across the screen like tile cards with a picture if the user
   uploaded one.  There will be a radio button so they can toggle between "view my recipes" and "view my cookbooks".
    There will be a link to log out, there will be a link to add a new recipe or manage my recipes, and a link to add
   a new cookbook or manage my cookbooks.

3. Manage My Recipes: (In the User Portal) The user will be able to add and delete their own recipes, the user will 
   be able to save fellow community members recipes to their cookbooks or remove fellow community members' recipe from
   a cookbook.

4. View / Browse / Search the community's recipes: (Available without login) A visitor will be able to search recipes by
   keyword, by ingredient, by prep time, and be able to scroll through results which would link to each recipe's page.

5. Manage My Cookbooks: (In the User Portal) The user will be able to add and delete their own cookbooks, as well as add
   and remove recipes from them.
